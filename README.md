# CS419RayTracer
Ray tracing engine used for CS 419 UIUC

This repository contains the code for my ray tracing engine for CS 419 at UIUC. This only contains the code for the ray tracing engine, and not the vector math library or other utility libraries that I've created and am using. I may add those to my github at some point as well.

Only contains the code and some output files, no executables or anything like that.

The output folders contain sample pictures and stats for each version. Each folder also contains a description file that describes what was including in that version.
NOTE: The average time per pixel was calculated incorrectly for all versions up to and including v1.3. You can take the reciprocal to get the correct time.
